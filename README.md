# Microstrip-Taper-Planar-Transition-using-ADS
Microwave circuit analysis in ADS showing the theoretical and simulated equivalence between transfer matrix cascades and S-parameter representations.


This repository presents a demonstration in **Keysight ADS** of the mathematical equivalence between:  

1. A **direct simulation** of a microstrip with taper transition, and  
2. A **cascaded transfer matrix approach** where:  

T_{total} = T_1 x T_2


followed by transformation into **S-parameters**.  

The results confirm the theoretical prediction that the **S-parameters of the combined structure** are identical to the **S-parameters derived from the cascaded T-matrices**.  


## üßæ Theory  

In microwave engineering, a two-port network can be characterized by multiple matrix representations.  
The scattering matrix (S-matrix) is convenient for describing reflection and transmission under matched port conditions, while the transfer matrix (T-matrix) is advantageous for analyzing cascaded structures.  


If two networks with T-matrices (T_1) and (T_2) are connected in cascade, the resulting network is:  

T_{total} = T_1 x T_2


After obtaining (T_{total}, one can transform back into the S-matrix domain:  

S_{total} = _f_(T_{total})

Thus, the theory guarantees that a direct S-parameter simulation of the combined network and the S-parameters derived via (T_1 x T_2) must be equivalent.  

This repository provides explicit ADS simulations as a proof of this equivalence.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Workflow  

1. **Component Setup in ADS and Simulation Cases**  
   A. Microstrip transmission line (MS) - S_parameters
      -Return Loss better than 30 dB
      -Insertion Loss betweem 0.095 to 0.145 dB in G-band
  ![S-Parameters](https://github.com/samueloladosu37/Microstrip-Taper-Planar-Transition-using-ADS/blob/main/MIcrostrip%20Simulation.png)

   B. Taper transition -S_parameters
      - Retrun Loss better than 20 dB
      - Insertion loss between 1.2  to 1.9 dB
   ![S-Parameters](https://github.com/samueloladosu37/Microstrip-Taper-Planar-Transition-using-ADS/blob/main/Taper%20SImulation.png)
 
   C. Direct combined simulation of MS + Taper (S_cascaded)
    ![S-Parameters](https://github.com/samueloladosu37/Microstrip-Taper-Planar-Transition-using-ADS/blob/main/S_combined(Microstrip-Taper%20Transiiton).png)
      - Retrun Loss better than 20 dB
      - Insertion loss between 1.2  to 2.1 dB
        
  D. Now let us transform the ( Sparameter to Tmatrix) using **stoabc** function in ADS
   - Microstrip S_parameter to ABCD matrix (T_microstrip)  
   - Taper S_parameter to ABCD matrix (T_taper)
   - Cascading: compute T_total = T_microstrip x T_taper

  E. Transform T_total into S_total (Scalc) using **abcdtos** function in ADS
     Compare Scalc with S_cascaded
 ![S-Parameters](https://github.com/samueloladosu37/Microstrip-Taper-Planar-Transition-using-ADS/blob/main/Comparison.png)

Using ADS we proofed the microwave theory- S-parameters of the combined structure is the same to the S-parameters derived from the cascaded T-matrices.  

2. **Bonus**  
   - Optimization of Planar to Dielectric Filled Rectangular Waveguide (DFWR) in G-band
   - Return Loss better than 20 dB
   - Insterloss Loss between 1.35 to 2.1
