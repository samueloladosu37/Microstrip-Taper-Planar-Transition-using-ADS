# Microstrip-Taper-Planar-Transition-using-ADS
Microwave circuit analysis in ADS showing the theoretical and simulated equivalence between transfer matrix cascades and S-parameter representations.


This repository presents a demonstration in **Keysight ADS** of the mathematical equivalence between:  

1. A **direct simulation** of a microstrip with taper transition, and  
2. A **cascaded transfer matrix approach** where:  

T_{total} = T_1 x T_2


followed by transformation into **S-parameters**.  

The results confirm the theoretical prediction that the **S-parameters of the combined structure** are identical to the **S-parameters derived from the cascaded T-matrices**.

## üßæ Theory  

In microwave engineering, a two-port network can be characterized by multiple matrix representations.  
The scattering matrix (S-matrix) is convenient for describing reflection and transmission under matched port conditions, while the transfer matrix (T-matrix) is advantageous for analyzing cascaded structures.  


If two networks with T-matrices (T_1) and (T_2) are connected in cascade, the resulting network is:  

T_{total} = T_1 x T_2


After obtaining (T_{total}, one can transform back into the S-matrix domain:  

S_{total} = _f_(T_{total})

Thus, the theory guarantees that a direct S-parameter simulation of the combined network and the S-parameters derived via (T_1 x T_2) must be equivalent.  

This repository provides explicit ADS simulations as a proof of this equivalence.

   - Independent extraction of T‚ÇÅ and T‚ÇÇ  
   - Cascading: compute \(T_{total} = T_1 \times T_2\)  
   - Transform \(T_{total}\) into \(S_{total}\)  

4. **Verification**  
   - Compare ADS results of direct vs. cascaded cases  
   - Confirm that \(S_{combined} \equiv S_{total}\)
